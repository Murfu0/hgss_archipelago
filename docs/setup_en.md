# Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)
- A US Pokémon HeartGold or SoulSilver ROM. The Archipelago community cannot provide this.
- [BizHawk](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory) version 2.10 or later

### Configuring BizHawk

Once you have installed BizHawk, open `EmuHawk.exe` and change the following settings:

- Go to `Config > Customize`. On the Advanced tab, disable (if it is not already) `Auto Save Ram`. Having this option
  enabled may not allow BizHawk to properly save for NDS games.
- Under `Config > Customize`, check the "Run in background" option to prevent disconnecting from the client while you're
  tabbed out of EmuHawk.
- Open an `.nds` file in EmuHawk and go to `Config > Controllers…` to configure your inputs. If you can't click
  `Controllers…`, load any `.nds` ROM first.
- Consider clearing keybinds in `Config > Hotkeys…` if you don't intend to use them. Select the keybind and press Esc
  to clear it.

## Generating and Patching a Game

1. Add `pokemon_hgss.apworld` to your `custom_worlds` folder in your Archipelago install. It should not be in
   `lib/worlds`.
2. Create your options file (YAML). You can make one by choosing `Generate Templates`
   from the Archipelago Launcher. From there, you can edit the `.yaml` in any text editor.
3. Follow the general Archipelago instructions
   for [generating a game on your local installation](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#on-your-local-installation).
   This will generate an output file for you. Your patch file will have the `.apheartgold` or `.apsoulsilver` file extension and will be
   inside the output file.
4. Open `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe`
5. Select "Open Patch" on the left side and select your patch file.
6. If this is your first time patching, you will be prompted to locate your vanilla ROM.
7. A patched `.nds` file will be created in the same place as the patch file.
8. On your first time opening a patch with BizHawk Client, you will also be asked to locate `EmuHawk.exe` in your
   BizHawk install.

If you're playing a single-player seed, and you don't care about autotracking or hints, you can stop here, close the
client, and load the patched ROM in any emulator. However, for multiworlds and other Archipelago features, continue
below using BizHawk as your emulator.

## Connecting to a Server

By default, opening a patch file will do steps 1-5 below for you automatically. Even so, keep them in your memory just
in case you have to close and reopen a window mid-game for some reason.

1. Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver uses Archipelago's BizHawk Client. If the client isn't still open from when you patched your game,
   you can re-open it from the launcher.
2. Ensure EmuHawk is running the patched ROM.
3. In EmuHawk, go to `Tools > Lua Console`. This window must stay open while playing.
4. In the Lua Console window, go to `Script > Open Script…`.
5. Navigate to your Archipelago install folder and open `data/lua/connector_bizhawk_generic.lua`.
6. The emulator and client will eventually connect to each other. The BizHawk Client window should indicate that it
   connected and recognized Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver.
7. To connect the client to the server, enter your room's address and port (e.g. `archipelago.gg:38281`) into the
   top text field of the client and click Connect.

You should now be able to send checked locations and receive items. You'll need to do these steps every time you want to reconnect. It is
perfectly safe to make progress offline; everything will re-sync when you reconnect.

## Playing with melonDS (macOS alternative - experimental)

BizHawk is the recommended and best-supported emulator. If you want a macOS alternative, you can
connect through melonDS using `connector_melonds_generic.lua` from this repository, which speaks
the same protocol as BizHawk's connector so Archipelago's BizHawk Client can talk to it unchanged.

The setup below is written for macOS and assumes the [NPO-197/melonDS-lua](https://github.com/NPO-197/melonDS-lua)
branch.

This path is experimental and has two one-time requirements:

- **A melonDS-lua build.** Follow the [BUILD.MD](https://github.com/NPO-197/melonDS-lua/blob/master/BUILD.MD)
  instructions for macOS. In practice that means installing the Homebrew deps listed there, cloning
  melonDS-lua, and building it with CMake.

- **LuaSocket for Lua 5.4**, staged where the connector looks for it (`~/.melonds-ap-lua`). Run the
  helper script from this repo, which installs LuaSocket with `luarocks` and stages it:
  ```
  ./tools/melonds_luasocket_setup.sh
  ```
  This produces `~/.melonds-ap-lua/share/lua/5.4/socket.lua` and
  `~/.melonds-ap-lua/lib/lua/5.4/socket/core.so`. (Set `MELONDS_LUASOCKET_DIR` to stage it elsewhere.)

Once those are in place:

1. Patch your ROM and open the BizHawk Client from the Archipelago Launcher as described above.
2. Load your patched `.nds` in melonDS and let it run past the title screen.
3. Open melonDS's Lua Script window, browse to `connector_melonds_generic.lua`, and run it.
4. The BizHawk Client will connect to melonDS automatically and recognize Pokémon HeartGold and
   SoulSilver. Connect to your room's address as in step 7 above.

## Common Issues

1. **Problem**: "No handler was found for this game." in the client. **Solution**: Update to at least BizHawk version 2.10.
2. **Problem (melonDS)**: the connector prints `module 'socket' not found`. **Solution**: run
   `./tools/melonds_luasocket_setup.sh` so the LuaSocket files exist under `~/.melonds-ap-lua`.
3. **Problem (melonDS)**: `require("socket")` fails even though `~/.melonds-ap-lua` exists. **Solution**:
   make sure melonDS-lua is built against the same Lua 5.4 toolchain that installed LuaSocket.
